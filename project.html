        I worked closely with financial advisors and internal stakeholders to prototype an experience that helps advisors better serve clients and be more productive outside of the office.

        The design team began the project by interviewing stakeholders at WFA's home office in St. Louis. We asked each person we spoke to about their vision for the project and about the organization's systems, structures and tools. Next, we interviewed advisors
        to better understand how they serve their clients – specifically, before, during and after client meetings.

    <div class="large-6 medium-8 small-12 large-centered medium-centered columns">
      <p>
        We then presented our findings back to the client and laid out our vision and recommendations for the app. For example, several advisors we interviewed were already using iPads to share financial documents during client meetings. These advisors were emailing
        themselves documents and storing them in iBooks. We recommended that the app include a place for organizing documents and sequencing presentations. Our recommendation aimed to better serve an existing need while keeping client information secure.

  <div class="row">
    <div class="large-6 medium-8 small-12 large-centered medium-centered columns">
      <p>
        Next, we created scenarios and low-resolution wireframes to illustrate typical workflows within the app. These scenarios also helped lead the organization away from thinking that's centered around internal structures and technologies, to thinking that
        based on workflows and creating a better user experience. For example, several of our scenarios suggested mingling data from multiple internal applications to provide succinct views of client information. We met with a group of advisors to validate
        our ideas. We also gained invaluable feedback on scenarios that failed to resonate.

      <p>
        In the next phase of the project, we created a detailed site map and wireframes of every screen in the app. Once complete, we created a tappable, interactive wireframe that financial advisors and stakeholders could download and test, just like a real
        app. We met again with a group of advisors to validate our designs and get their feedback on our progress.

      <p>
        After refining the wireframes, we created high-resolution visual designs, a styleguide and an interactive prototype. The prototype gained the enthusiastic support of the project’s executive sponsors and generated a lot of excitement within the organization. Development of the app began in late 2012.
